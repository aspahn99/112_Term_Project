To play single player battleship just run Battleship.py.

To play multi player battleship, first run Battleship_server.py in one window
then run Battleship.py in two different windows. If playing on different computers, when running Battleship.py type -i and the IP address of the computer running Battleship_server.py (the IP address will be printed out when the server code is run) 

Pygame must be installed to play.
